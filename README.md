# Stack-and-Collections

# üìå Project Overview:
This repository contains an implementation of a stack-based sorting program in Java. The project reads integers into a stack, allows operations such as adding, removing, and displaying the stack (sorted and unsorted), and follows best practices in object-oriented programming including:
 - Encapsulation: Using private variables with getter methods.
 - Single Responsibility Principle: Each class has a dedicated function.
 - Code Reusability: Leveraging Java‚Äôs built-in Stack and sorting methods from the collection framework.

```

# How to run the program by compiling

1 Navigate to root folder
```
  $ cd integer-reading-to-stack

```
2 Compile java files

```
  javac -d . implementation/*.java 
```

3 Run the program

```
  java implementation.Main
```

# How to Create the Documentation
